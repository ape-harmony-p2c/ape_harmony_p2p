## Ape Harmony P2C Funding

### ABSTRACT

Every NFT collection can create its own funding hub on Ape Harmony P2C simply by connecting any wallet with an NFT from that collection to the Ape Harmony contract. Only owners of that specific NFT have access to post requests for funding but all users have access to view the content on the funding hub as well as contribute funds to funding rounds. 

The primary purpose of funding rounds is to utilize the IP of the NFT collection and in so doing provide utility and increase the value of the entire NFT collection, but the rounds can be used for whatever the funding proposer chooses. This kickstarter style funding is just one of the many ways that Ape Harmony will provide functionality to NFT holders for monetization and leveraging of the value of their NFTs.

Ape Harmony is working to deliver a wide array of derivatives and other financial instruments from NFTs including P2P loans, equity backed liens, futures and options, packaged assets and insurance. Many NFTs are worth as much as a house, so it makes sense that they should be monetized as such.

### FUNDING HUBS

Funding hubs are the primary point of reference for every NFT and its community on the Ape Harmony ecosystem. For example BAYC will have its own subdomain p2c.bayc.apeharmony.com where all comnunity funding functionality is available to the holder of any BAYC NFT. When a user visits a funding hub, he will see all the NFTs relating to that collection on his profile. For example Bored Ape holder Jason will see on his Ape Harmony profile all the NFTs in his wallet which give him member privileges in the BAYC funding hub. 

### MEMBER PRIVILEGES

Member priveleges default to include the holder of any NFT in the collection (for example any BAYC holder) but as this is set by the NFT collection's deployer wallet, the BAYC funding hub can also be configured to give member privileges to anyone with a BAYC, MAYC, Otherside Deed, or any other NFT as well. All member privilege configurations are user defined. The primary privilege for holders of an NFT in the collection vs non-holders is the ability to create new rounds ie. requests for funding. In all other ways the UI will appear the same for both holders and non-holders.

### ROUNDS LIST

Upon entering the funding hub of an NFT collection on Ape Harmony visitor will see a list of funding rounds ie. requests for funding associated with that NFT collection eg. BAYC. All rounds appear as posts and are organized in a list like a Reddit thread. Posts of new rounds can be seen as the first post in a thread and every post after that a comment on that primary post. Again only holders of that NFT collection are allowed to create rounds ie. start a thread, but anyone can comment in the thread after it is created. 

Rounds are divided into two categories: COMPLETED and ACTIVE.

Active rounds are further filtered as follows:

1. Most funded ie. amount received as a percentage to total requested
2. Ending soonest (all funding rounds have expirations ie. that can not remain open indefinitely)
3. Most popular

Completed rounds are filtered as follows:

1. Funded & Not Funded (If a round fails to meet its target funding amount, the contributions to the round are refunded to the depositors upon expiration)
2. Most funded
3. Recent
4. Most popular

### COMMENTS

If a visitor to the BAYC funding hub on Ape Harmony is not a Bored Ape holder, he will not be allowed to create new rounds, and therefore the only type of posts he can submit are comments on already created rounds. This includes both active and completed rounds, but as the purpose of these threads are to support and inquire about projects seeking funding, active rounds will have much higher activity than completed rounds.


As a Bored Ape owner Jason will not only see the active and created rounds (posts) on the BAYC funding hub, he will also able to create a new round. As mentioned previously, funding rounds are requests for financing which are just posts in the BAYC funding hub. Every new round must include the amount the creator is seeking in either ETH or an ERC20 token specific to the funding hub's NFT collection like for example the ERC20 received in exchange for depositing your NFT on "Pooled NFTs".
