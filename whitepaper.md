## Ape Harmony P2C Funding

### LAYOUT

Main Site / specifc NFT collection

Main page for specific NFT collection

### FUNCTIONALITY

Each NFT collection gets its own funding hub where only owners of that specific NFT have access to post requests for funding. 

The primary purpose of funding rounds is to utilize the IP of the NFT collection and in so doing provide utility and increase the value of the entire NFT collection, but the rounds can be used for whatever the funding proposer chooses.

### FUNDING HUBS

Example: Bored Ape holder Jason goes to eg. bayc.p2c.apeharmony.com where he sees what NFTs he holds which give him member privileges in the BAYC funding hub. This defaults to any NFT in the BAYC collection, but is set by the NFT collection's deployer wallet or any wallets they choose to delegate that power to. For example, the BAYC funding hub can be configured to give member privileges to anyone with a BAYC, MAYC or Otherside Deed, or it can be restricted to only owners of BAYC NFTs etc.

### FUNDING ROUNDS

Any visitor to bayc.p2c.apeharmony.com will see a list of topics similar to reddit threads, but all threads are actually funding rounds associated with the BAYC collection. These rounds are divided into two categories: COMPLETED and ACTIVE. Except for comments, the only type of posts allowed in funding hubs are rounds ie. requests for funding.

### Comments

If a visitor to the BAYC funding hub on Ape Harmony is not a Bored Ape holder, he will not be allowed to create new rounds, and therefore the only type of posts he can submit are comments on already created rounds. This includes both active and completed rounds, but as the purpose of these threads are to support and inquire about projects seeking funding, active rounds will have much higher activity than completed rounds.

### MEMBER PRIVILEGES

As a Bored Ape owner Jason will not only see the active and created rounds (posts) on the BAYC funding hub, he will also able to create a new round. As mentioned previously, rounds are just posts in the BAYC funding hub which are not comments on another funding round. Every new round must include the amount the creator is seeking in either ETH or an ERC20 token specific to the funding hub's NFT collection like $APE or ERC20
