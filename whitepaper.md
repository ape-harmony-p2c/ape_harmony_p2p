### END TO END FINANCING FOR CREATORS

The biggest problem facing creators is the difficulty in raising sufficient financing in order to produce content or products on a professional level. For example in Hollywood, the typical pipeline from development to distribution of films can take several years, and this is magnified when the creators are newcomers operating on a grassroots level. The hunt for financing can be long and difficult, and connecting your investors and bankers to the distributor or studio in order to close the deal, requires engaging attorneys and others with similar experience.

Ape Harmony changes the rules of this game. We enable creators to propose funding rounds in Ape Harmony "funding hubs" specific to an NFT community like Bored Apes or Pudgy Penguins, so the project is targeted at those who would benefit most from their projects - members of their NFT community. Every NFT collection would benefit from creators building or making something utilizing their NFT's IP. This is a big win for both the NFT holders and the creators.

### Where does this funding come from?

**Of course these NFT holders can use their savings or spare ETH in their metamask but...**

Wouldn't it be more effective if we provided the means to monetize assets which they already have including the NFTs in the collection they want to support? Not only do we provide an ecosystem where NFT holders seeking funding can do so in a frictionless way, but through integration with protocols like Pooled NFT we also provide potential funders with the means to leverage their holdings.

For example Jason a BAYC holder wants to fund Amy for a project she is working on to create a new brand of headphones called ApeRoar because let's face it, Beats is not the only good brand name for headphones. Jason can deposit his NFT in the BAYC pool on Pooled NFT directly from the Ape Harmony UI, and purchase the ERC20 tokens representing contributions to Amy's project. And all this can be done without ever even leaving the Ape Harmony ecosystem.

### CROWDFUNDING and CREATOR ECONOMY

NFT sales in 2022 total volume was around 24 billion USD. But the crowdfunding and creator economy is worth more that 100 billion USD. So market expansion is the way to go. When an NFT collection mints it is in fact a kind of pre-sale but against some future more or less undefined utility. Crowdfunding is a form of pre-sale but with a well defined future utility, usually in the form of one or more of the products the creators are building. So this model can certainly be applied within NFT communities as well.

### CROWDFUNDING IN NFT COMMUNITIES

Take for example a typical Kickstarter project. Right now the top trending Kickstarter project is a robotic lawnmower. It's not too difficult to imagine the branding for this product to be based on some NFT collection. Something robotic? Crypto Punks and Nouns are pixel art which is kind of robotic. Nouns robotic lawnmower, anyone? But you don't need to invent something to sell to your own NFT community. Bored Apes for example are happy to support and buy everyday products like beer, hot sauce or burgers as long as their NFT branding is on them.

What about the arts? Many Kickstarter projects are for making a movie or something else creative. Well what if you wanted to make the craziest most detailed and complex digital painting of the Pudgy Penguins universe ever created? You could raise funding for that on Ape Harmony and deliver ownership of that digital painting as an NFT as a join ownership token held by everyone who funded it. The opportunities are endless.

### NFT IP on STEROIDS

We understand that a primary objective for all NFT collections is the development of their IP. Whether this be in the form of cartoons, comic books, YouTube videos, toys and merchandise, branding of a new soft drink, or a petting zoo with real apes, utilizing the IP in new and creative ways is a major goal of every NFT collection.

Holders of NFTs can now use Ape Harmony P2C to create requests for funding from holders of any NFT. This is peer to community funding. The use case is to create something which develops the IP of the NFT in question. Otherwise why would the community want to fund it?

We predict this will be used mostly for smaller projects in the beginning but it certainly would work for big ones as well. Sure Warner Bros or Dreamworks might make a deal to license the Bored Apes and make a movie out of it like they do with everything else good or bad. Remember the movie Battleship based on the old tabletop game? How about the Angry Birds animated film? Do we really want those guys handling our IP to make a movie from our beloved NFT collections? Nahhhh.

### Not Your NFT, Not Your Community

________________

### HOW IT WORKS

Using Ape Harmoeny P2C is simple. You simply go to https://apeharmony.com and choose the NFT community you wish to propose or fund a project in. If you fund one, you will be given an ERC20 token in proportion to the amount you funded which will be used to calculate the distributions from the project after it's completed.

**FUNDING HUBS** are the primary point of reference for every NFT and its community on the Ape Harmony ecosystem. For example BAYC will have its own subdomain p2c.bayc.apeharmony.com where all comnunity funding functionality is available to the holder of any BAYC NFT.

**FUNDING ROUNDS** are what visitors will see when visiting the funding hub of an NFT collection on Ape Harmony. They appear as a list of such requests for funding associated with that NFT collection eg. BAYC, and are organized like Reddit threads. New rounds are like the first post in a Reddit thread and every post after that is like a comment.

Rounds are divided into two categories: COMPLETED and ACTIVE.

Active rounds are further filtered as follows:

1. Most funded ie. amount received as a percentage to total requested
2. Ending soonest (all funding rounds have expirations ie. that can not remain open indefinitely)
3. Most popular

Completed rounds are filtered as follows:

1. Funded & Not Funded (If a round fails to meet its target funding amount, the contributions to the round are refunded to the depositors upon expiration)
2. Most funded
3. Recent
4. Most popular

___________

### But How Do It Know

Every round must include the amount the creator is seeking and the formula for distribution of value from the project being funded. This can be in either ETH, an ERC20 token specific to the funding hub's NFT collection like for example the ERC20 received in exchange for depositing your NFT on "Pooled NFTs", or some other form of value such as NFTs with some utility attached to it.

Anyone can contribute to any funding round. When a user contributes to a round he receives ERC20 tokens specific to that round in amount proportional to his contributions. When the project distributes value back to the contributors of the round, the user receives an amopunt in proportion to his tokens. These ERC20 tokens are how the contract keeps track of what each contributor is entitled to.

The ERC20 tokens of each round can themselves be traded on the open market. Although we do not ourselves fund liquidity pools for these tokens which would directly create monetary value, as the primary purpose of these tokens is to create value in our own ecosystem ie. the "Disney dollars" model, it is possible that the round tokens themselves could have value outside our ecosystem as well through trading by users and other third parties.

____________

### Anything Else?

The main purpose of funding rounds is to utilize the IP of the NFT collection and in so doing provide utility and increase the value of the entire NFT collection, but the rounds can be used for whatever the funding proposer chooses. This kickstarter style funding is just one of the many ways that Ape Harmony will provide functionality to NFT holders for monetization and leveraging of the value of their NFTs.

Ape Harmony is working to deliver a wide array of derivatives and other financial instruments from NFTs including P2P loans, equity backed liens, futures and options, packaged assets and insurance. Many NFTs are worth as much as a house, so it makes sense that they should be monetized as such.
