## Ape Harmony P2C Funding

### LAYOUT

Main Site / specifc NFT collection

Main page for specific NFT collection

### FUNCTIONALITY

Each NFT collection gets its own funding hub where only owners of that specific NFT have access to post requests for funding. 

The primary purpose of funding rounds is to utilize the IP of the NFT collection and in so doing provide utility and increase the value of the entire NFT collection, but the rounds can be used for whatever the funding proposer chooses.

### FUNDING HUBS

Bored Ape holder Jason goes to eg. bayc.p2c.apeharmony.com where he sees what NFTs he holds which give him member privileges in the BAYC funding hub. This defaults to any NFT in the BAYC collection, but is set by the NFT collection's deployer wallet or any wallets they choose to delegate that power to. For example, the BAYC funding hub can be configured to give member privileges to anyone with a BAYC, MAYC or Otherside Deed, or it can be restricted to only owners of BAYC NFTs etc.
